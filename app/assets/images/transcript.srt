Hello and welcome to the myFlashcards Virtual Flashcard System tutorial.

1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Today I am going to be showing you how to use the MyFlashcards

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Virtual Flashcard System.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The first thing that we need to do is register an account

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and the way we do this is that we go to the top right

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
hand corner of the screen and click the register button.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
From here we need to enter our registration details

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which is very simple; it's just an email and a password.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You also need to do a password confirmation to make sure

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
you spelt the password correctly.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Once you have done that you need to click on the create user button.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This will create an account and log you in to the front page.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
As you can see it says you are logged in as demo@demo.com

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
which is the email address that we specified when we registered.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Here are the statistics and at the moment we have no flashcards

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
no reviews, and no new cards, which is to be expected as this is a new account.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If you look here it also says that we have no decks created.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The next thing we need to do is to create our first deck.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
this is done by going to the top of the screen and clicking on the manage decks button.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
From this screen we can create our first deck.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This is done by typing in the name of the deck in the text field at the top of the screen.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm going to call this deck 'Japanese'.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Once you have done that you need to click on the create deck button.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
As you can see, once that is done a message appears at the top of the screen that says

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
that the deck has been created. We can also see the deck listed in the table below.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And, you will notice that at the moment the deck is empty and there is a card count of zero.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
There are two different ways to manage the flashcards in this deck:

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You can click on the manage flashcards link at the top of the screen which will allow you to manage the flashcards in any deck

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
not just this deck.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Or, you can click on the manage flashcards button here which allows you to manage the flashcards of this specific deck.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
For now I'm going to manage the flashcards for this deck by clicking on the button here.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
As you can probably tell, the flashcard manager is very similar to the deck manager.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We have a form at the top of the screen which allows you to create a new flashcard and the deck has automatically been selected as the Japanese deck.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
From here we can enter the front and the back of the flashcard.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So, as an example I'm going to write the flashcard here. And once you fill that in you click on the create flashcard button.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
A message has appeared at the top of the screen again, this time it says that a flashcard has been created.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And we can see in the table below our flashcard which is in the Japanese deck. Here we have the front of the card. The back of the card. When the card is due. And some tools such as edit and delete.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The due is something worth explaining. This is the main focus of this website.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's a spacing algorithm which determines how often you will see this flashcard.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,000
As an example; if you have 10,000 flashcards, each with a different word, and you want to make sure that you know all of these words on all of these flashcards...

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's not viable to review 10,000 flashcards every day because this will take a long amount of time.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So what we have is a spaced repetition algorithm which tries to predict when you are going to forget the flashcard and will only show you the flashcard directly before you are about to forget that card.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What that means is you can have 10,000 flashcards but you are only reviewing 20 or 30 in one day.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Which can significantly reduce the amount of time that you spend reviewing flashcards.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Now that we have our first flashcard it's time to try reviewing our flashcards.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's important to note that you don't review individual flashcards; you review the deck that the flashcards are a part of.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The first thing we need to do is go to the top of the screen and click on the manage decks button.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
From here we can see our deck the Japanese deck, it now has a card count of 1 which is to be expected.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
To review this, all we need to do is click on the review deck button.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This screen is the reviewing screen.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
As you can see, this is the front of the flashcard which is now visible, and the back of the flashcard is invisible at the moment.

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You have to click on the reveal answer button to see the answer.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What you have to do is try to guess what is on the back of the flashcard just as you would with a traditional flashcard.

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I know that the answer to this is hello so I'm going to click on the reveal answer button. As you can see the back of the flashcard is now visible and I was correct.

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There are four buttons at the bottom of the screen here and these are for grading how difficult it was for you to answer that card.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Now for me that flashcard was very easy so I would normally click on the easy button.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
However, I'm just going to show you that if you click on the again button you will just review the same flashcard again.

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If you are reviewing more than one flashcard you will see more flashcards before you come up with the same flashcard again.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The idea is to grade how difficult that was and that allows the algorithm to predict when you are likely to forget this flashcard.

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That concludes the tutorial, thank you for watching. Stay tuned as more videos will be released in the future for other features that are being added to myFlashcards. Thank you.
